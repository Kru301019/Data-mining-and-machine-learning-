Description
Scraped Movies Dataset
I scraped the data for Hydra Movies entire collection of full movies - 3,940 movies in total. Much of the metadata is available via their API however they do not provide director, writer, cast & short summaries in their public datasets so I decided to scrape it. Each movie includes the following metadata:

Movie title
Year of Release
Full Summary
Short Summary
Genres
Films IMDB Unique Identifier
Movie Runtime
YouTube Trailer ID
Rating
Movie Poster (via URL path)
Director
Writer
Cast
Hopefully webmasters & movie enthusiasts will find this data useful
